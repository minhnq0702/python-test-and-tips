We&#x27;ve trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;</a><p>If you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a>, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: 
“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM</a>

“Elon Musk singing Fly Me To The Moon by Sinatra”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C</a><p>Our tool at Infinity allows creators to type out a script with what they want their characters to say (and eventually, what they want their characters to do) and get a video out. We’ve trained for about 11 GPU years (~$500k) so far and our model recently started getting good results, so we wanted to share it here. We are still actively training.<p>We had trouble creating videos of good characters with existing AI tools. Generative AI video models (like Runway and Luma) don’t allow characters to speak. And talking avatar companies (like HeyGen and Synthesia) just do lip syncing on top of the previously recorded videos. This means you often get facial expressions and gestures that don’t make sense with the audio, resulting in the “uncanny” look you can’t quite put your finger on. See blog.<p>When we started Infinity, our V1 model took the lip syncing approach. In addition to mismatched gestures, this method had many limitations, including a finite library of actors (we had to fine-tune a model for each one with existing video footage) and an inability to animate imaginary characters.<p>To address these limitations in V2, we decided to train an end-to-end video diffusion transformer model that takes in a single image, audio, and other conditioning signals and outputs video. We believe this end-to-end approach is the best way to capture the full complexity and nuances of human motion and emotion. One drawback of our approach is that the model is slow despite using rectified flow (2-4x speed up) and a 3D VAE embedding layer (2-5x speed up).<p>Here are a few things the model does surprisingly well on: (1) it can handle multiple languages, (2) it has learned some physics (e.g. it generates earrings that dangle properly and infers a matching pair on the other ear), (3) it can animate diverse types of images (paintings, sculptures, etc) despite not being trained on those, and (4) it can handle singing. See blog.<p>Here are some failure modes of the model: (1) it cannot handle animals (only humanoid images), (2) it often inserts hands into the frame (very annoying and distracting), (3) it’s not robust on cartoons, and (4) it can distort people’s identities (noticeable on well-known figures). See blog.<p>Try the model here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a><p>We’d love to hear what you think!"

It&#x27;s designed to give you insights beyond just price data.
Why Chainspy?<p>- On-Chain Metrics: Track blockchain activity (e.g., transactions, active users) across multiple networks, all in one place.<p>- Advanced Charting: Visualize blockchain data with integrated TradingView charts. Ideal for comparing blockchain performance over time.<p>- Wealth Distribution: See how wealth is distributed across wallets and spot centralization trends.<p>- API Access (Coming Soon): Need blockchain data for your projects? We&#x27;re working on an API—let me know if you&#x27;re interested!<p>A Sneak Peek:<p>Wealth Distribution: How is wealth spread across wallets? <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KaPC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KaPC.png</a> <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KdOv.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KdOv.png</a><p>Active Transactions: Which chains are seeing the most activity? <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KAvg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KAvg.png</a><p>Active Users (addresses): How many people are using the network? <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KHiI.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talkimg.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;9KHiI.png</a><p>I’m just starting out and would love feedback on features and data you&#x27;d like to see.

AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, embeddings, vector databases, and more—all in one seamless package.<p>We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.<p>From these iterations &amp; feedback, we have a couple of key learnings I wanted to share:<p>- &quot;Chat with your docs&quot; solutions are a dime-a-dozen<p>- Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too isolated from other tools<p>- Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic box needs to be magic to them.<p>- Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a terminal is a non-starter for most.<p>- Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal preference or legal constraints<p>- Everything needs to be in one place<p>From these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:<p>- Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully customizable for advanced users.<p>- Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers &amp; models.<p>- Built-in Vector Database, most users don&#x27;t even know that it is there.<p>- Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user wants to.<p>- Scrape websites, import Github&#x2F;GitLab repos, YouTube Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in for the user.<p>- An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.<p>- All of this just works out of the box in a single installable app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user does, chats, or configures is stored on the user&#x27;s device. Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux<p>We have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate users&#x27; abilities to add more niche agent skills, data connectors, and more.<p>*But there is even more*<p>We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player version of AnythingLLM. We publish a Docker image too (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mintplexlabs&#x2F;anythingllm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mintplexlabs&#x2F;anythingllm</a>) that supports multi-user management with permissioning so that you can easily bring AnythingLLM into an organization with all of the same features with minimal headache or lift.<p>The Docker image is for those more adept with a CLI, but being able to comfortably go from a single-user to a multi-user version of the same familiar app was very important for us.<p>AnythingLLM aims to be more than a UI for LLMs, we are building a comprehensive tool to leverage LLMs and all that they can do while maintaining user privacy and not needing to be an expert on AI to do it.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anythingllm.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anythingllm.com&#x2F;</a>"
