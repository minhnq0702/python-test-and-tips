We&#x27;ve trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;</a><p>If you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a>, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: 
“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM</a>

“Elon Musk singing Fly Me To The Moon by Sinatra”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C</a><p>Our tool at Infinity allows creators to type out a script with what they want their characters to say (and eventually, what they want their characters to do) and get a video out. We’ve trained for about 11 GPU years (~$500k) so far and our model recently started getting good results, so we wanted to share it here. We are still actively training.<p>We had trouble creating videos of good characters with existing AI tools. Generative AI video models (like Runway and Luma) don’t allow characters to speak. And talking avatar companies (like HeyGen and Synthesia) just do lip syncing on top of the previously recorded videos. This means you often get facial expressions and gestures that don’t make sense with the audio, resulting in the “uncanny” look you can’t quite put your finger on. See blog.<p>When we started Infinity, our V1 model took the lip syncing approach. In addition to mismatched gestures, this method had many limitations, including a finite library of actors (we had to fine-tune a model for each one with existing video footage) and an inability to animate imaginary characters.<p>To address these limitations in V2, we decided to train an end-to-end video diffusion transformer model that takes in a single image, audio, and other conditioning signals and outputs video. We believe this end-to-end approach is the best way to capture the full complexity and nuances of human motion and emotion. One drawback of our approach is that the model is slow despite using rectified flow (2-4x speed up) and a 3D VAE embedding layer (2-5x speed up).<p>Here are a few things the model does surprisingly well on: (1) it can handle multiple languages, (2) it has learned some physics (e.g. it generates earrings that dangle properly and infers a matching pair on the other ear), (3) it can animate diverse types of images (paintings, sculptures, etc) despite not being trained on those, and (4) it can handle singing. See blog.<p>Here are some failure modes of the model: (1) it cannot handle animals (only humanoid images), (2) it often inserts hands into the frame (very annoying and distracting), (3) it’s not robust on cartoons, and (4) it can distort people’s identities (noticeable on well-known figures). See blog.<p>Try the model here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a><p>We’d love to hear what you think!"

It&#x27;s designed to give you insights beyond just price data.
Why Chainspy?<p>- On-Chain Metrics: Track blockchain activity (e.g., transactions, active users) across multiple networks, all in one place.<p>- Advanced Charting: Visualize blockchain data with integrated TradingView charts. Ideal for comparing blockchain performance over time.<p>- Wealth Distribution: See how wealth is distributed across wallets and spot centralization trends.<p>- API Access (Coming Soon): Need blockchain data for your projects?

AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, embeddings, vector databases, and more—all in one seamless package.<p>We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.<p>From these iterations &amp; feedback, we have a couple of key learnings I wanted to share:<p>- &quot;Chat with your docs&quot; solutions are a dime-a-dozen<p>- Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too isolated from other tools<p>- Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic box needs to be magic to them.<p>- Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a terminal is a non-starter for most.<p>- Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal preference or legal constraints<p>- Everything needs to be in one place<p>From these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:<p>- Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully customizable for advanced users.<p>- Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers &amp; models.<p>- Built-in Vector Database, most users don&#x27;t even know that it is there.<p>- Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user wants to.<p>- Scrape websites, import Github&#x2F;GitLab repos, YouTube Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in for the user.<p>- An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.<p>- All of this just works out of the box in a single installable app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user does, chats, or configures is stored on the user&#x27;s device. Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux<p>We have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate users&#x27; abilities to add more niche agent skills, data connectors, and more.<p>*But there is even more*<p>We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player version of AnythingLLM. We publish a Docker image too (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mintplexlabs&#x2F;anythingllm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mintplexlabs&#x2F;anythingllm</a>) that supports multi-user management with permissioning so that you can easily bring AnythingLLM into an organization with all of the same features with minimal headache or lift.<p>The Docker image is for those more adept with a CLI, but being able to comfortably go from a single-user to a multi-user version of the same familiar app was very important for us.<p>AnythingLLM aims to be more than a UI for LLMs, we are building a comprehensive tool to leverage LLMs and all that they can do while maintaining user privacy and not needing to be an expert on AI to do it.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anythingllm.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anythingllm.com&#x2F;</a>"

We&#x27;re building an LLM platform that optimizes request routing, autocorrects bad responses, and automatically fine-tunes new application-specific models with incremental improvements. Here’s a demo video:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?sid=7097fd84-ea85-42cd-9616-84abc1087a56"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?...</a>.<p>If you want to try it out, we built a game (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maitaistreasure.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maitaistreasure.com</a>) to show how our real-time autocorrections work with mission-critical expectations (like never giving financial advice). Try and coax the bot to give you the secret phrase in its system prompt. If you&#x27;re the first to crack it, you can email us the phrase and win a bounty. Maitai is used to make sure the bot always adheres to our expectations, and thus never gives up the secret phrase.<p>We built Maitai because getting an LLM app into production and maintaining it is a slog. Teams spend most of their time on LLM reliability rather than their main product. We experienced this ourselves at our previous jobs deploying AI-enabled applications for Presto—the vast majority of time was making sure the model did what we wanted it to do.<p>For example, one of our customers builds AI ordering agents for restaurants. It&#x27;s crucial that their LLMs return results in a predictable, consistent manner throughout the conversation. If not, it leads to a poor guest experience and a staff member may intervene. At the end of the order conversation, they need to ensure that the order cart matches what the customer requested before it&#x27;s submitted to the Point of Sale system. It&#x27;s common for a human-in-the-loop to review critical pieces of information like this, but it’s costly to set up such a pipeline and it’s difficult to scale. When it&#x27;s time to send out a receipt and payment link, they must first get the customer&#x27;s consent to receive text messages, else they risk fines for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. To boot, getting from 0 to 1 usually relies on inefficient general-purpose models that aren&#x27;t viable at any sort of scale beyond proof of concept.<p>Since reliability is the #1 thing hindering the adoption of LLMs in production, we decided to help change that. Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>1. Maitai sits between the client and the LLMs as a super lightweight proxy, analyzing traffic to automatically build a robust set of expectations for how the LLM should respond.<p>2. The application sends a request to Maitai, and Maitai forwards it to the appropriate LLM (user specified, but we&#x27;ll preemptively fallback to a similar model if we notice issues with the primary model).<p>3. We intercept the response from the LLM, and evaluate it against the expectations we had previously built.<p>4. If we notice that an expectation was not met, we surface a fault (Slack, webhook) and can, optionally, substitute the faulty response with a clean response to be sent back to the client. This check and correction adds about 250ms on average right now, and we&#x27;re working on making it faster.<p>5. We use all of the data from evaluating model responses to fine-tune application-specific models. We&#x27;re working on automating this step for passive incremental improvements. We&#x27;d like to get it to a point where our user&#x27;s inference step just gets better, faster, and cheaper over time without them having to do anything.<p>Our hope is that we take on the reliability and resiliency problems of the LLMs for our customers, and make it so they can focus on domain specific problems instead.<p>We&#x27;re self-serve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.trymaitai.ai"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.trymaitai.ai</a>), and have both Python and Node SDKs that mock OpenAI&#x27;s for quick integration. Users can set their preferences for primary and secondary (fallback) models in our Portal, or in code. Right now, the expectations we use for real-time evaluations are automatically generated, but we manually go through and do some pruning before enabling them. Fine-tuning is all done manually for now.<p>We charge for platform usage, plus a monthly application fee. Customers can bring their own LLM provider API keys, or use ours and pay at-cost for what they use. We have contracts with most of our current customers, so we are still trying to figure out what&#x27;s right for our pay-as-you-go plan.<p>We securely store requests and responses that go through Maitai, as well as derivative data such as evaluation results. This information is used for fine-tuning models, accessible only by the organization the data belongs to. Data is never shared between our users.  API keys we manage on behalf of our customers are only injected before sending to the LLM provider, and never leave our servers otherwise. We&#x27;re working on SOC2 and HIPAA compliance, as well as a self-hosted solution for companies with extremely sensitive data privacy requirements.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on what we’re building, or hear about your experience building around LLMs!"
