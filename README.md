# python-tools

### This is a collection of python tools that I have created for my personal purposes (absolutely, for software development ðŸ˜†).

### The tools are:
- **[Make Checksum](checksum/main.py)**: A tool to organize files in a directory.
- **[Create Certificate & Private Key](digital-sign-p12/create_pem.py)**: A tool to create a certificate and a private key.
- **[Create P12](digital-sign-p12/create_sign.py)**: A tool to create a p12 file from a certificate and a private key.
