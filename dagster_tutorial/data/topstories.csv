We&#x27;ve trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toinfinityai.github.io&#x2F;v2-launch-page&#x2F;</a><p>If you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a>, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: 
“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3z8l1TM</a>

“Elon Musk singing Fly Me To The Moon by Sinatra”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;47jyC7C</a><p>Our tool at Infinity allows creators to type out a script with what they want their characters to say (and eventually, what they want their characters to do) and get a video out. We’ve trained for about 11 GPU years (~$500k) so far and our model recently started getting good results, so we wanted to share it here. We are still actively training.<p>We had trouble creating videos of good characters with existing AI tools. Generative AI video models (like Runway and Luma) don’t allow characters to speak. And talking avatar companies (like HeyGen and Synthesia) just do lip syncing on top of the previously recorded videos. This means you often get facial expressions and gestures that don’t make sense with the audio, resulting in the “uncanny” look you can’t quite put your finger on. See blog.<p>When we started Infinity, our V1 model took the lip syncing approach. In addition to mismatched gestures, this method had many limitations, including a finite library of actors (we had to fine-tune a model for each one with existing video footage) and an inability to animate imaginary characters.<p>To address these limitations in V2, we decided to train an end-to-end video diffusion transformer model that takes in a single image, audio, and other conditioning signals and outputs video. We believe this end-to-end approach is the best way to capture the full complexity and nuances of human motion and emotion. One drawback of our approach is that the model is slow despite using rectified flow (2-4x speed up) and a 3D VAE embedding layer (2-5x speed up).<p>Here are a few things the model does surprisingly well on: (1) it can handle multiple languages, (2) it has learned some physics (e.g. it generates earrings that dangle properly and infers a matching pair on the other ear), (3) it can animate diverse types of images (paintings, sculptures, etc) despite not being trained on those, and (4) it can handle singing. See blog.<p>Here are some failure modes of the model: (1) it cannot handle animals (only humanoid images), (2) it often inserts hands into the frame (very annoying and distracting), (3) it’s not robust on cartoons, and (4) it can distort people’s identities (noticeable on well-known figures). See blog.<p>Try the model here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.infinity.ai&#x2F;try-inf2</a><p>We’d love to hear what you think!"

AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, embeddings, vector databases, and more—all in one seamless package.<p>We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.<p>From these iterations &amp; feedback, we have a couple of key learnings I wanted to share:<p>- &quot;Chat with your docs&quot; solutions are a dime-a-dozen<p>- Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too isolated from other tools<p>- Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic box needs to be magic to them.<p>- Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a terminal is a non-starter for most.<p>- Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal preference or legal constraints<p>- Everything needs to be in one place<p>From these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:<p>- Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully customizable for advanced users.<p>- Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers &amp; models.<p>- Built-in Vector Database, most users don&#x27;t even know that it is there.<p>- Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user wants to.<p>- Scrape websites, import Github&#x2F;GitLab repos, YouTube Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in for the user.<p>- An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.<p>- All of this just works out of the box in a single installable app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user does, chats, or configures is stored on the user&#x27;s device. Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux<p>We have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate users&#x27; abilities to add more niche agent skills, data connectors, and more.<p>*But there is even more*<p>We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player version of AnythingLLM.

We&#x27;re building an LLM platform that optimizes request routing, autocorrects bad responses, and automatically fine-tunes new application-specific models with incremental improvements. Here’s a demo video:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?sid=7097fd84-ea85-42cd-9616-84abc1087a56"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?...</a>.<p>If you want to try it out, we built a game (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maitaistreasure.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maitaistreasure.com</a>) to show how our real-time autocorrections work with mission-critical expectations (like never giving financial advice). Try and coax the bot to give you the secret phrase in its system prompt. If you&#x27;re the first to crack it, you can email us the phrase and win a bounty. Maitai is used to make sure the bot always adheres to our expectations, and thus never gives up the secret phrase.<p>We built Maitai because getting an LLM app into production and maintaining it is a slog. Teams spend most of their time on LLM reliability rather than their main product. We experienced this ourselves at our previous jobs deploying AI-enabled applications for Presto—the vast majority of time was making sure the model did what we wanted it to do.<p>For example, one of our customers builds AI ordering agents for restaurants. It&#x27;s crucial that their LLMs return results in a predictable, consistent manner throughout the conversation. If not, it leads to a poor guest experience and a staff member may intervene. At the end of the order conversation, they need to ensure that the order cart matches what the customer requested before it&#x27;s submitted to the Point of Sale system. It&#x27;s common for a human-in-the-loop to review critical pieces of information like this, but it’s costly to set up such a pipeline and it’s difficult to scale. When it&#x27;s time to send out a receipt and payment link, they must first get the customer&#x27;s consent to receive text messages, else they risk fines for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. To boot, getting from 0 to 1 usually relies on inefficient general-purpose models that aren&#x27;t viable at any sort of scale beyond proof of concept.<p>Since reliability is the #1 thing hindering the adoption of LLMs in production, we decided to help change that. Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>1. Maitai sits between the client and the LLMs as a super lightweight proxy, analyzing traffic to automatically build a robust set of expectations for how the LLM should respond.<p>2. The application sends a request to Maitai, and Maitai forwards it to the appropriate LLM (user specified, but we&#x27;ll preemptively fallback to a similar model if we notice issues with the primary model).<p>3. We intercept the response from the LLM, and evaluate it against the expectations we had previously built.<p>4. If we notice that an expectation was not met, we surface a fault (Slack, webhook) and can, optionally, substitute the faulty response with a clean response to be sent back to the client. This check and correction adds about 250ms on average right now, and we&#x27;re working on making it faster.<p>5. We use all of the data from evaluating model responses to fine-tune application-specific models. We&#x27;re working on automating this step for passive incremental improvements. We&#x27;d like to get it to a point where our user&#x27;s inference step just gets better, faster, and cheaper over time without them having to do anything.<p>Our hope is that we take on the reliability and resiliency problems of the LLMs for our customers, and make it so they can focus on domain specific problems instead.<p>We&#x27;re self-serve (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.trymaitai.ai"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.trymaitai.ai</a>), and have both Python and Node SDKs that mock OpenAI&#x27;s for quick integration. Users can set their preferences for primary and secondary (fallback) models in our Portal, or in code. Right now, the expectations we use for real-time evaluations are automatically generated, but we manually go through and do some pruning before enabling them. Fine-tuning is all done manually for now.<p>We charge for platform usage, plus a monthly application fee. Customers can bring their own LLM provider API keys, or use ours and pay at-cost for what they use. We have contracts with most of our current customers, so we are still trying to figure out what&#x27;s right for our pay-as-you-go plan.<p>We securely store requests and responses that go through Maitai, as well as derivative data such as evaluation results. This information is used for fine-tuning models, accessible only by the organization the data belongs to. Data is never shared between our users.  API keys we manage on behalf of our customers are only injected before sending to the LLM provider, and never leave our servers otherwise. We&#x27;re working on SOC2 and HIPAA compliance, as well as a self-hosted solution for companies with extremely sensitive data privacy requirements.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on what we’re building, or hear about your experience building around LLMs!"

They developed AlphaFold3 as their model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from big pharma. They already signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3 billion - Google’s becoming a pharma company! (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isomorphiclabs.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isomorphiclabs.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;isomorphic-labs-kick...</a>)<p>AlphaFold3 is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can do three main things: (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2) Predict the structure of drug-protein interactions; (3) Predict nucleic acid - protein complex structure.<p>AlphaFold3 is incredibly important for science because it vastly accelerates the mapping of protein structures. It takes one PhD student their entire PhD to do one structure. With AlphaFold3, you get a prediction in minutes on par with experimental accuracy.<p>There’s just one problem: when DeepMind published AlphaFold3 in May (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07487-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07487-w</a>), there was no code. This 
brought up questions about reproducibility (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-024-01463-0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-024-01463-0</a>) as well as complaints from the scientific community (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion-alphafold-3-open-source&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion-alphafold-3-open-sourc...</a>).<p>AlphaFold3 is a fundamental advance in structure modeling technology that the entire biotech industry deserves to be able to reap the benefits from. Its applications are vast, including:<p>- CRISPR gene editing technologies, where scientists can see exactly how the DNA interacts with the scissor Cas protein;<p>- Cancer research - predicting how a potential drug binds to the cancer target. One of the highlights in DeepMind’s paper is the prediction of a clinical KRAS inhibitor in complex with its target.<p>- Antibody &#x2F; nanobody to target predictions. AlphaFold3 improves accuracy on this class of molecules 2 fold compared to the next best tool.<p>Unfortunately, no companies can use it since it is under a non-commercial license!<p>Today we are releasing the full model trained on single chain proteins (capability 1 above), with the other two capabilities to be trained and released soon. We also include the training code. Weights will be released once training and benchmarking is complete. We wanted this to be truly open source so we used the Apache 2.0 license.<p>Deepmind published the full structure of the model, along with each components’ pseudocode in their paper. We translated this fully into PyTorch, which required more reverse engineering than we thought!<p>When building the initial version, we discovered multiple issues in DeepMind’s paper that would interfere with the training - we think the deep learning community might find these especially interesting. (Diffusion folks, we would love feedback on this!) These include:<p>- MSE loss scaling differs from Karras et al. (2022). The weighting provided in the paper does not downweigh the loss at high noise levels.<p>- Omission of residual layers in the paper - we add these back and see benefits in gradient flow and convergence. Anyone have any idea why Deepmind may have omitted the residual connections in the DiT blocks?<p>- The MSA module, in its current form, has dead layers. The last pair weighted averaging and transition layers cannot contribute to the pair representation, hence no grads. We swap the order to the one in the ExtraMsaStack in AlphaFold2. An alternative solution would be to use weight sharing, but whether this is done is ambiguous in the paper.<p>More about those issues here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ligo-Biosciences&#x2F;AlphaFold3"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ligo-Biosciences&#x2F;AlphaFold3</a><p>How this came about: we are building Ligo (YC S24), where we are using ideas from AlphaFold3 for enzyme design. We thought open sourcing it was a nice side quest to benefit the community.<p>For those on Twitter, there was a good thread a few days ago that has more information:

A huge thanks to OpenFold for pioneering the previous open source implementation of AlphaFold
We did a lot of our early prototyping with proteinFlow developed by Lisa at AdaptyvBio we also look forward to partnering with them to bring you the next versions!
We are also partnering with Basecamp Research to supply this model with the best sequence data known to science.
